I would expect that CD-ROM software would not even need copy protection.
As the program on a CD-ROM would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is
impossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a
CD-ROM, copies of the software (that still work) could never be made.

Hmmm.. now that I think about it.. with a creative TSR, maybe
disk-swapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk. You
would need a tonne of disks though.
