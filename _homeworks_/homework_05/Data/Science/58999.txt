I seem to recall that there was an article in Radio Electronics about this
subject. In fact I have a copy of the article in front of me, but I can't
find anywhere in the article a refrence as to what month it was in. The system
they describe uses an automobile ignition coil for the high voltage. The 
article even includes some information on what kind of film to use and where 
to get it. 

Hope this helps.
