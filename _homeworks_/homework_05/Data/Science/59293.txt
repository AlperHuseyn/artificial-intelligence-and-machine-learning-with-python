Summary: Poor person's Kirlian


Poor person's Kirlian Photography (try this at home)

1. Hold your hand up to a cold window.
2. Look closely at the stunning corona effects around
   your fingertips.
3. Remove hand (from window) and observe after image.  
4. Invent crackpot theory to explain the effect.
