I disagree, if for no other reason than that there are already other 
standards in place.  Besides, even if they restrict encryption on the NREN, 
who cares?  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway.  The NREN is only for 
geovernment and university research (read the proposals--it's a "data 
superhighway" for Cray users, not anything having to do with the Internet).
