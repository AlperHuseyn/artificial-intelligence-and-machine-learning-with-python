HB 1776 is for Concealed Carry in Texas.  It provides for licensing
citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction
course (30 hours, if I remember correctly), pay a $140 fee (good for
4 years), and meet several other criteria related to personal
character, etc.

While I don't agree with all of the criteria, I feel it's high time
that pro-gun types fight the same way HCI et al. do -- by getting
incremental changes in the law.
