Didn't the new study asked "have you engaged in homosexual intercourse
within the last two years" whereas Kinsey asked "have you ever engaged
or thought about engaging in homosexual activity".  Sort of like the 
difference between "did you have yogurt this morning" and "are you 
allergic to lactose".
