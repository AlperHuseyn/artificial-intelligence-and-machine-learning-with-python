It's public because it belongs to everybody.  It's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light.  If they can sell you
or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent
of its light, they make more _money_.  Never mind that your money is wasted.
Never mind that taxpaper's money is wasted.  Never mind that the sky is ruined.
